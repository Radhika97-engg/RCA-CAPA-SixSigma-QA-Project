# Takt Time – SMT Production Line

## What is Takt Time?
**Takt Time** is the rate at which a finished product must be completed to meet customer demand.  
It helps determine the *pace* of production and identify *bottlenecks or inefficiencies* in the process.

> Takt is derived from the German word **"Taktzeit"**, meaning **"drumbeat"** – representing the rhythm of production.

## Takt Time Formula

Takt Time (T) = Ta / Td

Where:  
- **T** = Takt Time  
- **Ta** = Net Available Time per day (in minutes or seconds)  
- **Td** = Total Customer Demand per day (units)

---

## SMT Project Application

### Net Available Time (Ta):
- Shift Duration: 8 hours/day = 480 minutes  
- Breaks: 60 minutes (lunch, tea, etc.)  
- Available Production Time = 480 - 60 = **420 minutes/day**

### Total Customer Demand (Td):
- Expected output = **105 good units/day**

---

## Calculated Takt Time

Takt Time = 420 minutes / 105 units = 4 minutes/unit

---

## Interpretation & Use

| Parameter         | Value        |
|------------------|--------------|
| Takt Time        | 4 min/unit   |
| Actual C/T (avg) | ~7 min/unit  |
| Gap              | 3 min     |

> **Observation:** The actual cycle time per unit is higher than takt time, indicating the need to:  
- Reduce delays or rework in QA and manual mounting  
- Investigate and remove non-value added activities  
- Improve machine uptime and balance workloads

---

## How Takt Time Helps in Lean:

- Sets the **expected pace** of operations  
- Highlights **flow mismatches** and **bottlenecks**  
- Drives **line balancing** and **workforce planning**  
- Supports continuous improvement efforts during the **Improve** phase
