# Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ)

## Overview

Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ) refers to the costs associated with providing poor-quality products or services. In the SMT production line under study, high defect rates during initial testing contribute to both visible and hidden quality costs.

The iceberg model highlights that visible costs (inspection, rework) represent just the top, while hidden costs like cycle delays and lost customer loyalty have long-term business impact.

## Iceberg of COPQ – Categorization

### Tangible & Visible Costs (Top of the Iceberg)
| Category           | Examples in SMT Production         | Estimated Impact |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Inspection**      | Manual inspection before delivery   | Medium           |
| **Rework**          | Soldering defects; component repair | High             |
| **Defects**         | Failed boards in first pass testing | High             |
| **Idle Time**       | Delay in next batch due to rework   | Medium           |
| **Overtime**        | QC team extended hours              | Low–Medium       |

### Hidden & Intangible Costs (Below the Surface)
| Category               | Examples in SMT Production                         | Risk Level |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Long Cycle Times**    | Extended time from mounting to testing             | High       |
| **Redundant Processes** | Repeat inspection for reworked boards             | Medium     |
| **Cost of Capital**     | Inventory pileup due to delays                     | Medium     |
| **Inaccurate Reports**  | Improper failure log updates                       | Medium     |
| **Missed Commitments**  | Delay in dispatch to Panasonic/Havells partners   | High       |
| **Lost Sales**          | Risk of losing trust from clients                 | High       |
| **Expediting Costs**    | Rushed logistics to meet revised deadlines         | Medium     |
| **Lost Customer Loyalty** | OEM reputation loss due to frequent quality issues | Very High |

## Insight

> While visible COPQ (e.g., rework and inspection) is being tracked, the **intangible costs**—like missed timelines, excessive planning, and reputation damage—pose a greater long-term risk.

Focusing only on the top layer underestimates the true cost of quality failure. This project aims to **reduce first-pass failure rate**, thereby lowering both **rework cost** and **hidden intangible costs** through process control and defect prevention strategies.
