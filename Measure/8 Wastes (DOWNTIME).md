# 8 Wastes (DOWNTIME)

## What Is Waste?

In Lean Six Sigma, **waste** is defined as:

> “Anything other than the minimum amount of equipment, materials, effort, or information that is absolutely essential to add value to a product or service.”

These non-value-added activities consume time, money, or space without adding value, and should be systematically reduced or eliminated.

## The 8 Wastes – DOWNTIME Framework

The acronym **DOWNTIME** represents the 8 major types of waste:

| Acronym | Waste Type                | Description                                                                                          | Indicators in SMT/QA Context                              |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **D**   | **Defects**               | Rejects or errors that require rework, wasting resources and time.                                  | Failed PCBs, soldering errors, rework loops.               |
| **O**   | **Overproduction**        | Producing more than needed or too early in the process.                                              | Testing more boards than required; redundant testing.      |
| **W**   | **Waiting**               | Idle time caused by delays, approvals, or resource unavailability.                                   | Boards waiting for inspection or approval; idle testers.   |
| **N**   | **Non-Utilized Talent**   | Underuse of employee skills due to poor job design or lack of training.                              | QA team doing repetitive tasks; engineers not involved in RCA. |
| **T**   | **Transportation**        | Unnecessary movement of products or data.                                                            | Moving boards across distant departments manually.         |
| **I**   | **Inventory**             | Excess raw materials or WIP that is not immediately needed.                                          | Unused components; excessive WIP at soldering/testing.     |
| **M**   | **Motion**                | Unnecessary physical movement of people or equipment.                                                | Operators walking between stations due to poor layout.     |
| **E**   | **Excess Processing**     | Performing more work than what is required by the customer.                                          | Multiple approval layers; duplicate inspection steps.      |

## Summary

Identifying and eliminating the 8 wastes is key to improving process efficiency and quality. By applying the **DOWNTIME** model to your SMT line or QA workflow, you can:

- Reduce cycle time
- Improve first-pass yield
- Enhance resource utilization
- Deliver more value to the customer
