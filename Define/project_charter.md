# Project Charter â€“ Reducing First-Pass Failure in SMT Line through Root Cause Analysis and Six Sigma

---

## Business Case
To improve quality control in the SMT (Surface Mount Technology) process by reducing the **defect rate in PCB solder joints**, which currently causes high rework and return costs. The project aims to enhance first-pass yield (FPY), reduce customer complaints, and drive operational excellence through root cause analysis and CAPA implementation.

---

## Problem Statement
In the last 3 months, the SMT production line has shown a **14% first-pass failure rate**, primarily due to poor solder joint quality and component misalignment. This not only delays the final product delivery but also increases rework time, labor cost, and customer dissatisfaction. If unresolved, the organization risks missing delivery SLAs and jeopardizing ISO 9001 compliance readiness.

---

## Goal Statement
To reduce the first-pass failure rate on the SMT line from **14% to below 5%** within **60 days**, through structured RCA, actionable CAPAs, and real-time quality monitoring , enabling cost savings of $X and increasing process reliability.

## Project Scope

**Longitudinal Scope:**
- Start: Component placement begins on SMT Line 1
- End: Final functional test prior to packing

**Lateral Scope:**
- SMT Line 1 (Main line for PCB assembly for medical devices)
- Soldering, reflow, SPI, and AOI inspection processes

**Out of Scope:**
- Manual mounting post-AOI
- Non-medical device PCBs
