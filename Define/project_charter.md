# Project Charter â€“ Reducing First-Pass Failure in SMT Line

---

## Business Case  
To improve quality control in the SMT (Surface Mount Technology) process by reducing the defect rate in PCB solder joints, which currently causes high rework and return costs. The project aims to enhance first-pass yield (FPY), reduce customer complaints, and drive operational excellence through root cause analysis and CAPA implementation.

---

## Problem Statement  
In the last 3 months, the SMT production line has shown a **14% first-pass failure rate**, primarily due to **poor solder joint quality** and **component misalignment**. This not only delays the final product delivery but also increases rework time, labor cost, and customer dissatisfaction.  
> If unresolved, the organization risks missing delivery SLAs and jeopardizing **ISO 9001** compliance readiness.

---

## Goal Statement  
To reduce the **first-pass failure rate** on the SMT line from **14% to below 5%** within **60 days**, through structured **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**, actionable **Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs)**, and **real-time quality monitoring**.  
> Expected outcomes: cost savings of **$X** and improved **process reliability**.

## Project Scope

**Longitudinal Scope:**  
- **Start:** Component placement begins on SMT Line 1  
- **End:** Final functional test prior to packing

**Lateral Scope:**  
- **Included:**  
  - SMT Line 1 (PCB assembly for medical devices)  
  - Soldering, reflow, SPI, and AOI inspection processes  
- **Excluded:**  
  - Manual mounting post-AOI  
  - Non-medical device PCBs
