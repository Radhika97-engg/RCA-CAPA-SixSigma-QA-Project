# Elevator Pitch – RCA-CAPA-SixSigma-QA-Project

Have you ever wondered why we’re facing delays in delivery and rework costs on the SMT line?

In the past 3 months, our Surface Mount Technology process has shown a **14% first-pass failure rate**, mostly due to poor solder joints and component misalignment. This is not just affecting timelines, it’s risking **ISO 9001 compliance** and leading to rising customer complaints.

I’m leading a Six Sigma project focused on **reducing this failure rate to below 5% within 60 days** using root cause analysis and CAPA methodology.

By identifying hidden process issues and implementing real-time quality monitoring, we expect to save costs, improve first-pass yield, and deliver more reliable products.

We’ll measure success through improved FPY metrics, reduced rework time, and fewer internal defect tickets.

With your support, we can make this a benchmark for operational excellence.
