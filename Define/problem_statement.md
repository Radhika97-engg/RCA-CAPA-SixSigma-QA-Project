# Problem Statement

## Situation:
At an electronics manufacturing facility, the Surface Mount Technology (SMT) line has been reporting a **14% first-pass failure rate** on assembled Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). This defect rate exceeds the internal quality threshold of 5% and has resulted in delayed deliveries, increased rework costs, and reduced customer satisfaction.

## Task:
As part of the Process Quality team, I was tasked with **leading a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) initiative** to identify why the defect rate was so high and to propose a corrective action plan to bring the failure rate within acceptable limits.

## Action:
A Six Sigma DMAIC approach was adopted to address the issue. The Define phase included:
- Capturing Voice of Customer (VOC) from both internal stakeholders and external clients.
- Creating a **CTQ (Critical to Quality) Tree** to break down key customer expectations.
- Conducting **Kano Analysis** to prioritize requirements.
- Drafting a detailed **Project Charter**.
- Mapping the current process using **SIPOC** and identifying ownership using **RACI Matrix**.

## Result (Expected):
The goal of this project is to **reduce the first-pass failure rate from 14% to below 5% within 8 weeks**, while also ensuring preventive controls are implemented through tools like FMEA and CAPA.

## Notes:
- Business Impact: Reduction in rework costs, improved throughput, and higher delivery reliability.
- Tools Used: SIPOC, Kano, CTQ Tree, Project Charter, RACI Matrix, Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone), CAPA.
