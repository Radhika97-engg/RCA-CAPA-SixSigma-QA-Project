# Kano Analysis â€“ SMT QA Improvement Project

## What is the Kano Analysis Tool?

The Kano Model is a customer satisfaction framework that helps classify product or service features based on how they affect customer satisfaction. It categorizes needs into five types: Must-be, One-dimensional, Attractive, Indifferent, and Reverse. This helps teams prioritize improvements based on what truly matters to the customer.

## Kano Analysis Table

| Customer Feedback (VOC)                                                | Need                                 | Kano Category      | Reasoning                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Too many boards failing SPI even though they look fine"              | SPI inspection accuracy              | Must-be             | Customers expect defect-free boards; failure leads to dissatisfaction.    |
| "The machine keeps misplacing components randomly"                    | Equipment stability                  | One-dimensional     | The more stable the machine, the higher the customer satisfaction.       |
| "We can't trace the root cause for recent reworks"                    | Better traceability                  | Must-be             | Root cause analysis is a basic expectation in QA processes.              |
| "We lose time fixing tiny soldering errors manually"                  | Reduce manual rework                 | One-dimensional     | Faster throughput = higher satisfaction.                                  |
| "We received 2 out of 10 boards not working"                          | Product reliability                  | Must-be             | This directly impacts customer trust; basic expectation.                 |
| "We would love live defect dashboards"                                | Real-time defect tracking dashboard  | Attractive          | This isn't expected but would impress customers.                         |
