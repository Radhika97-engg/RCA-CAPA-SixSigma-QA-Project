# SIPOC Diagram â€“ SMT First Pass Yield Improvement Project

The SIPOC diagram provides a high-level overview of the SMT line quality inspection and correction workflow targeted in this project. It maps out the critical flow from supplier to customer.

---

## Title: Reduce First-Pass Failure Rate in SMT Line from 14% to < 5% within 60 Days

---

### Process Start and End:
- **Start:** Start of SMT production (first piece inspection)
- **End:** Final quality clearance before delivery
