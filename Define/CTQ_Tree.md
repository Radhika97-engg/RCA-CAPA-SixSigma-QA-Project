# CTQ Drill Down Tree – SMT First-Pass Failure Reduction Project

## Purpose:
To translate broad customer needs into measurable Critical to Quality (CTQ) metrics that will guide the project.

| **Need**                 | **Drivers (Customer Requirements)**               | **CTQ Metrics (Measurable Requirements)**                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Reliable PCB Quality     | Accurate Inspection                              | SPI false failure rate < 2%                              |
|                          | Stable Component Placement                        | Component placement accuracy ≥ 98%                       |
|                          | Low Manual Rework                                 | First Pass Yield (FPY) ≥ 95%                             |
|                          | High Reliability in End Product                   | Field failure rate < 1%                                  |
|                          | Full Traceability of Rework                       | 100% digital rework log availability                     |

## Notes:
- CTQs were derived from VOC + Affinity Diagram themes.
- These metrics will drive measurement, analysis, and control throughout the DMAIC phases.
