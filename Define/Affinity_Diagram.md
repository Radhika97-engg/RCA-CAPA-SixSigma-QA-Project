# Affinity Diagram â€“ RCA CAPA Six Sigma Project

## Purpose:
The Affinity Diagram is used to organize Voice of Customer (VOC) feedback into thematic clusters. This helps identify key improvement areas from unstructured feedback.

---

## Steps Followed:
1. **Recorded feedback** from various stakeholders as sticky-note style comments.
2. **Displayed all comments** visually using draw.io for sorting.
3. **Grouped the comments** into 5 major categories based on content similarity.
4. **Created header cards** for each group based on recurring concerns.
5. **Drew the final diagram** (see `Affinity_Diagram.png`).

## Final Clusters:

| Cluster Name               | Representative VOC Example                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inspection Accuracy        | "Too many boards failing SPI even though they look fine"                |
| Equipment/Machine Stability| "The machine keeps misplacing components randomly"                      |
| Rework & Yield Efficiency  | "We lose time fixing tiny soldering errors manually"                    |
| Product Reliability        | "We received 2 out of 10 boards not working"                            |
| Quality Traceability       | "We can't trace the root cause for recent reworks"                      |
